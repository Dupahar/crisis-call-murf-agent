🚨 We built an "AI Stress Inoculation" engine. (Sound On 🔊)

Most crisis training is boring slides or expensive actors. We fixed that.

Introducing CrisisCall: An AI-powered training platform that measures "Grace Under Pressure."

🧠 THE PROBLEM:
You can't learn to handle a panicked 911 caller by reading a PDF. You need to feel the pressure. Standard AI is too slow to simulate that fear.

⚡ THE SOLUTION:
We built a "Dynamic Escalation Engine" specifically for the Murf Voice Agent Hackathon.

1. The AI listens to your hesitation.
2. If you pause for >3 seconds, the victim SCREAMS.
3. It forces you to think fast and speak clearly.

Powered by @Murf AI's Falcon, we achieved <500ms latency. No robotic pauses. Just pure, high-stakes adrenaline.

USE CASES:
✅ 112 Dispatch Training
✅ Suicide Prevention Hotlines
✅ Corporate Crisis Management

Check out the demo below. Would you crack under pressure? 👇
